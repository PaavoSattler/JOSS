# Summary

**HypoShrink** is an R package for optimizing and comparing linear
hypotheses in the context of quadratic forms, especially the
ANOVA-type-statistics (ATS). Built on the theoretical foundation by
Sattler & Rosenbaum (2025) [@sattler2025], the package provides
practical tools to construct *companion hypothesis matrices*, identify
redundant hypothesis specifications, and assess equivalence under ATS,
while reducing the number of rows and thereby the computational effort.

In classical hypothesis testing with ATS, different hypothesis matrices
may encode the same null hypothesis but yield different test statistic
values and, consequently, different test results. However, *companion*
hypothesis matrices always yield identical test statistics and
decisions. Their computational efficiency, rank, or numerical stability
can nevertheless vary substantially. **HypoShrink** addresses this by
providing:

-   Explicit companion matrix generation for the centering matrix,
-   Hypothesis transformation into companion form,
-   Equivalence checking under various ATS types,
-   Quantification of computational savings via dimension reduction.

**HypoShrink** is designed for applied statisticians, data analysts, and
researchers working with multivariate models where hypothesis
specification needs to be both rigorous and efficient. This is
especially relevant for resampling methods, permutation tests, and
high-dimensional settings. The package is available on GitHub at
[https://github.com/PSattlerStat/HypoShrink](https://github.com/PSattlerStat/HypoShrink).


# Statement of Need

Linear hypotheses in multivariate statistics (e.g., in MANOVA or GLM
frameworks) are often specified via a matrix-vector pair $(H, c)$, where
the hypothesis matrix $H$ represents linear combinations of parameters
and $c$ is a corresponding vector. These specifications are not unique —
multiple different $(H, c)$ pairs may encode the same null hypothesis.
The choice of matrix can influence the value of the test statistic, as
well as numerical properties, computational cost, and interpretability.

In their 2025 publication, Sattler & Rosenbaum [@sattler2025] introduce
a systematic way to reduce such hypotheses via *companion matrices* that
preserve statistical equivalence under ATS. This continues and
complements earlier work by Sattler & Zimmermann [@sattler2024] on the
Wald-type-statistic (WTS). Despite the theoretical importance of these
results, no software package in R or other environments made these tools
directly accessible to users — until now.

**HypoShrink** fills this gap by enabling:

-   Creation of companion matrices that are equivalent under ATS,
-   Simplification of hypothesis specifications without altering test
    outcomes,
-   Assessment of efficiency potential,
-   Analytical comparison of different hypothesis formulations.

This contributes to reproducibility, numerical robustness, and
interpretability in applied statistical modelling.

# Features

| Function | Purpose |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `CenteringCompanion(d)` | Returns the companion for standard centering matrix of dimension $d$. |
| `CompanionHypothesis()` | Transforms a given hypothesis $(H, c)$ into an equivalent companion. |
| `CompareHypotheses()` | Compares two hypotheses for equivalence under four ATS quadratic forms. |
| `HypothesisPotential()` | Computes relative savings in complexity/dimension from companion usage. |

# Usage Examples

```r
library(HypoShrink)

# 1. Companion matrix of size 4

P <- CenteringCompanion(d = 4)

# 2. Transform hypothesis to companion form

H <- matrix(c(1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 2)
c <- c(0, 0) 
comp <- CompanionHypothesis(H, c, utrapez = TRUE)

# 3. Compare two hypotheses under ATS

H2 <- matrix(c(1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 2)
c2 <- c(0, 0) 
CompareHypotheses(H, c, H2, c2)

# 4. Assess potential computational gain

HypothesisPotential(H, c)

```
